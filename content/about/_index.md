**As a UCSD CSE PhD**. I am a 1st year PhD student at [Dept. Computer Science and Engineering at UC San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu/). My research interest currently focus on **LLM system**, particularly serving systems that make modern LLM-backed applications work efficiently and effectively. I am also interested in **database systems** and in particular data analytics systems that enable users to interact with data in a more intuitive and efficient manner.    


**As a Technical Leader in DataChat**. Before joining UCSD, I was a technical leader at [DataChat](https://www.datachat.ai/), a startup company that focuses on building a conversational analytics platform. I was one of the early engineers in the company, and had the opportunity to work on various projects, including the core backend system, the data processing pipeline, the natural langauge system, etc. I was also involved in the design and implementation of the core features of the product, and had the opportunity to work with the product team to understand the user requirements and feedback. I was also involved in the hiring process, and had the opportunity to interview and mentor new engineers and interns. I also led a team of size 5-10 on designing the core backend systems to support DataChat application running on top. _(Paragraph generated by Github Copilot but yes i did all these but can it generate a shorter one... üòê)_

**As a student at UW-Madison**. I got my master [the Computer Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/), advised by [Jignesh Patel](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jignesh/), and was a part of the [UW-Madison Database Group](https://twitter.com/wiscdb?lang=en). My research interests was in the intersection of databases and data analytics systems. I was particularly interested in building systems that enable users to interact with data in a more intuitive and efficient manner. I also got my undergrad degree in Computer Science / Math at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I also spent some amazing time side tracking into astronomy ([Ka Ho Yuen](https://www.khyuen.info/)), biochemistry (the [Senes Lab](https://seneslab.biochem.wisc.edu/)), and geoscience ([Yuhao Kang](http://www.kkyyhh96.site/)), where I worked with experts in the field to understand more in different fields of science. I enjoyed my 6 amazing years in Madison, and I am always grateful for the opportunities and experiences that I had there.



<!-- I am also passionate about teaching and mentoring. 
During my years in DataChat, I also mentored 10+ colleagues and interns during work and after, and some of them become successful as leaders in the company or in their own careers. -->
