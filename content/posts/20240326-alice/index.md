## What is this?
I always reflect back on my journey in DataChat after starting my PhD: What have I done right? What are the stuff that I wish I could improve? What inspired me and shaped my core value in my career? What have I missed out? What would I do if I start over again? What did the company do well / need improvement? 

As a result, I decided to write something about my journey in DataChat, and share some thoughts and experiences with people. I wrote this under the name of "Alice", a fictional character who embarks her journey in the Wondertech, a small startup company, and learns about the world of engineering, leadership, and life. It is not meant to be only a reflection of my journey - it is an invitation to everyone who is interested in being successful in a tech company to collectively think about important topics in different stages of their career: the excitement, the frustration, the joy, the sadness, the success, the failure, the growth, the stagnation, the leadership, the teamwork, the innovation, the legacy, the future - all of these are the elements that I hope as an invitation of discussion to include different journeys and experiences under the hood of Alice.


## Progress
**(2024/3)**: I have organized a very preliminary slide deck, and had presented in some small "meetup" style events. I am currently working on the first draft of the slide deck, which includes 9 chapters and I'm still on chapter 3... 

The more important thing is to make it interactive - possibly with AI - to engage people in the discussion, and to get feedback from them.
